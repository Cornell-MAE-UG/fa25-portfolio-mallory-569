My name is Mallory Moore, and I am a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering with minors in Aerospace and Business. I love continuously learning through hands on work and collaboration. I am looking forward to growing my engineering skills at Cornell, on my project team, and beyond.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
